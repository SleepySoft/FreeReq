# FreeReq
A free and open source requirement management tool.

I need a light-weight, free, Caliber (a Borland software) like requirement management tool. But I didn't find one. So I wrote such a software.


# Introduce
FreeReq can organize requirement document as tree structure. A requirement entry can have its sub requirement entry.

The name, ID, and content are the basic information of a requirement entry. 

* The name will show as the node name in tree view
* The ID is a unique identifier of a requirement entry, which can be referenced in discussion.
* The content is the main description of a requirement entry.

More requirement entry information can be added by editing the metadata. The editor ui will automatically generate the editing controls.
